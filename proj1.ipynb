This might help us see that for restaurants that do fairly well in inspections, they typically fall under similar \"score buckets\" as there are gaps in the bar graph towards the far right of the figure versus the far left. On the contrary, as restaurants receive worse inspection scores, the score might be more \"nit-picky\" resulting in more unique scores and thus more of a normal distribution."
